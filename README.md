This project was created in the winter of 2023 for CMSC 150
The object of the game is to battle through the gyms with your Pok√©mon.
The game utilizes the Random and Scanner classes from Java.
Additionally, it functions by creating objects from the classes PokeClass and PokeGym, which I created.
Finally, the class gameMaterials contains the static methods used in the game. These are primarily methods with lots of print statements because using them in a static method shortens the length of the main game class PokeGame. 
I created all executed code throughout the project, including, but not limited to. the for/while loops, enhanced for loops, if/else statements, mutable objects, classes, random number generators, and user inputs.
