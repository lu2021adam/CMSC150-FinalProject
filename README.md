This project was created in the winter of 2023 for CMSC 150
The object of the game is to battle through the gyms with your Pok√©mon.
The game utilizes the Random and Scanner classes from Java.
Additionally, it functions by creating Pokemon objects from PokeClass and Battler objects using BattleClass, which I created.
Finally, the class gameMaterials contains the static methods used in the game. These are primarily methods with lots of print statements because they shortened the length of the main game implementing class: PokeGame. 
I created all executed code throughout the project, including, but not limited to: the for/while loops, enhanced for loops, if/else statements, mutable objects, classes, random number generators, and user inputs.
